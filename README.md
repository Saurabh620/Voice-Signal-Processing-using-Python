In this project we used TESS voice dataset  and  processed it and perform emotion prediction
The principal objective of this endeavor is to employ sophisticated Signal Processing methodologies for the
purpose of decoding and scrutinizing emotional cues present in speech signals. 

CNN and LSTM model is used in this project
The system must effectively prepare the TESS dataset through various preprocessing steps, ensuring the data
is cleaned, normalized, and segmented for consistent analysis. It should implement signal processing
techniques such as waveplot generation, spectrogram computation, and feature extraction methods like
MFCCs and Mel spectrograms to capture essential audio features.

Dataset used in this project Toronto emotional speech set (TESS)
